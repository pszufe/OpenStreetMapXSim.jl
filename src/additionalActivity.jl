Additional activity selector

Creates df_AdditionalActivity dataframe and returns point_before and point_after on the way 
pointA - point_before - pointB - point_after, if they exist.

** Arguments   
* `routingMode` : TODO explain
* `agent_profile` : TODO explain
* `DA_home` : TODO explain
* `DA_work`  : TODO explain
TODO : explain other args
             
** Assumptions
 - there is max one point_before and max one point_after for each agent
 - model can be extended by introducing more points_before and more points_after based on 
   df_AdditionalActivity dataframe, which already returns multiply before and after points. 
   To do so one should modify below "if" condintion
